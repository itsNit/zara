            <h1>Concerns over risks posed by unqualified Chiropractors</h1>
            <p class="indent">Chiropractic care is a form of alternative medicine that involves the manipulation of the spine and other parts of the body to improve health and wellness. The practice has gained popularity over the years, with millions of people visiting chiropractors each year to relieve pain, improve mobility, and enhance their overall health. However, there are valid concerns on fake chiropractors performing treatments without being properly trained and qualified.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest risks of unqualified chiropractors is the potential for misdiagnosis. Chiropractors often make diagnoses based on physical exams, medical history and the patient’s symptoms, but without the proper training and education, an unqualified chiropractor may misdiagnose a patient’s condition. This can lead to improper treatment, which can worsen the patient’s condition and cause further injury. For example, an unqualified chiropractor may misdiagnose a spinal problem and perform an adjustment that can result in nerve damage or even paralysis.</p>

However, like any medical procedure, there are some common effects arising from chiropractic treatments. These include temporary pain, stiffness or soreness in the treated area, headache as well as fatigue, which should be carefully noted. To avoid any unnecessary risks and ensure safetyin treatment, it is important to do the following:</p>

                <li><p><b>Follow the recommended treatment plan: </b>Your chiropractor will develop a personalized treatment plan for you, be sure to follow it as closely as possible.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Communicate any concerns:</b> If you experience any discomfort or have any questions during treatment, don’t hesitate to bring it up to your chiropractor.</p></li>
