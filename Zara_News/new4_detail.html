            <h3 style="padding-top: 20px;">How to treat sport injuries effectively without drugs?</h3>
            <p class="indent">Chiropractic care can be a very effective way to manage and treat many sport injuries conditions without using drugs or surgery. When the spinal joints & musculoskeletal are not moving correctly, it can cause tissue damage, further limiting the range of motion and contributing to various health issues. By using hands to adjust misaligned structures, our Zara doctors perform a correction on the bodyâ€™s structural alignment to restore balance to the body, returning them to their natural position and reducing pressure on spinal nerve.</p>
            <p> <b>There are many benefits that sport players or athletes can gain from chiropractic treatment including:</b> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve posture and reduce the risk of injury</li>
                <li>Optimize body balance and reflex</li>
                <li>Speed up recovery time</li>
                <li>Reduced pain and inflammation</li>
                <li>Improve performance of movement for athletes</li>
                <li>Enhance strength and flexibility of whole body</li>
                <li>Reduced Stress, Better Focus and Concentration.</li>
